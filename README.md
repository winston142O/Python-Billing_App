This is a billing app for an insurance company I worked for, they were starting out so they didn't provide me a lot of information to work with.
In this app the seller can type in the details of the client as well as the services purchased and the total price to pay,
to create a formal invoice with a bill number in order to keep a record of their clients' purchases. After the invoice is generated it gets
turned into a PDF file automatically for easier handling and allows the seller to quickly pass it over by email.
